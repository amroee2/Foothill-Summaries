We can build different types of applications using ASP.Net including

- Server Side Rendering: Where the user makes an HTTP Request and we return a dynamic HTML Content to the user, like ASP.Net core MVC

- Services: API Projects that the user can send a request to and then get content, typically in JSON, used commonly by front end developers to integrate with Backend

- Client Side Rendering: New type of projects that when the user sends a request, the server returns an application that the user can run on their side, and any needed JSON files for the application to work will be sent by the server
