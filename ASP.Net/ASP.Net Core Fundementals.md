We can build different types of applications using ASP.Net including

- Server Side Rendering: Where the user makes an HTTP Request and we return a dynamic HTML Content to the user, like ASP.Net core MVC

- Services: API Projects that the user can send a request to and then get content, typically in JSON, used commonly by front end developers to integrate with Backend

- Client Side Rendering: New type of projects that when the user sends a request, the server returns an application that the user can run on their side, and any needed JSON files for the application to work will be sent by the server

## ASP.Net Core Architecture

The bottom architucture platform represents ASP.Net core, while the top ones represents applications platforms that can be built using ASP.Net core.

ASP.Net Core MVC Refers to the Model View Controller Architecture pattern that existed well before ASP.Net core itself, Where the Model represents the entities in the application, Controller for handling API Requests and the view for front end options.

Razor and Blazor pages are front end options for ASP.Net core, they came out since the front end options had some issues in ASP.Net core MVC

And ASP.Net Web APIS (and minimal apis) refer to the services application we talked about.
