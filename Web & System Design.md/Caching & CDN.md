# Caching & CDN

Caching and Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) are both techniques used to improve the performance, scalability, and reliability of websites or web applications, but they serve different purposes and operate in different ways.

# Caching

Caching is the process of storing copies of data in temporary storage (a "cache") so that future requests for that data can be served faster.

There are multiple levels of caching

### Browser Caching

Browsers cache static resources (like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and images) so they don't need to be downloaded again during subsequent page loads.

### Server Side Caching

- In-memory caching: Storing frequently accessed data (like database query results) in memory using solutions like Redis or Memcached.
Application-level caching: Storing computed results (e.g., results of an expensive operation) at the application layer, such as with ASP.NET's in-built cache mechanisms.

- Database caching: Query results are cached to reduce repeated access to the database for the same information.

### Reverse Proxy Caching

A reverse proxy like Varnish or NGINX can cache responses from the backend and serve them to users directly, reducing the load on the server.

## Benefits of Caching

- Improved performance: Faster response times for users by serving cached data instead of regenerating it.

- Reduced server load: Fewer requests hitting the backend services.

- Lower latency: Especially in cases like edge caching (CDN) where data is served closer to the user.

# CDN

A CDN is a globally distributed network of servers that deliver web content based on a user's geographic location. The goal is to reduce latency by serving content from servers that are closer to the user.

- Edge Servers: CDN providers maintain edge servers located in different regions around the world. When a user requests a piece of content (such as an image or a video), the CDN serves it from the nearest edge server.

- Static Content Delivery: CDNs are commonly used for delivering static assets like images, JavaScript files, CSS, and videos.

- Dynamic Content Caching: Some CDNs also cache dynamic content, although it is more challenging since dynamic data can frequently change.


## Benefits of Using a CDN:

- Improved load times: Content is delivered faster because it comes from servers geographically closer to the user.

- Scalability: CDNs can handle high traffic loads, distributing it across multiple servers.

- DDoS Protection: Many CDNs provide security features, including protection from Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks.

- Reduced bandwidth costs: By offloading requests from the origin server, CDNs reduce the bandwidth load on your main infrastructure.

**Combining Caching and CDNs**

For the best performance:

- Cache frequently used data on the server to reduce repetitive processing.

- Use a CDN to cache and distribute static and dynamic content globally, ensuring users experience faster load times regardless of their location.
