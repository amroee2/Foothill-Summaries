# Docker

Docker is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications inside lightweight, isolated environments called containers. Containers are a solution for reliably running software across different environments without the "it works on my machine" problem, providing consistency regardless of where your application is deployed.

## Containers

Containers are isolated environments that bundle an application with everything it needs to run, including code, system libraries, dependencies, and environment variables.

Each container runs independently, without interfering with other containers or the host system. Containers use the underlying operating system (OS) kernel, which makes them lightweight compared to virtual machines (VMs).

Because containers include all dependencies, they can be moved across environments—like from a developer's laptop to a production server—without compatibility issues.

## Docker Images

A Docker image is a blueprint for a container. It’s a snapshot that includes all necessary software, libraries, and configuration files.

Docker images use a layered filesystem, which means each layer represents a different version or component of the application, making images smaller and more efficient.

You can create a new image by building on top of an existing one, making it easy to reuse components and keep images modular.

## Docker Engine

The Docker Engine is the core service that enables container management. It runs on your host system and is responsible for creating, running, and managing containers.

The Docker Engine provides commands for starting, stopping, and interacting with containers, as well as tools for image creation, networking, and storage.
