# Software Testing

Software Testing is a method to check whether the actual software product matches expected requirements and to ensure that software product is Defect free. It involves execution of software/system components using manual or automated tools to evaluate one or more properties of interest. The purpose of software testing is to identify errors, gaps or missing requirements in contrast to actual requirements. In simple terms, Software Testing means the Verification of Application Under Test (AUT).

**Why is Software Testing Important?**

Software Testing is Important because if there are any bugs or errors in the software, it can be identified early and can be solved before delivery of the software product. Properly tested software product ensures reliability, security and high performance which further results in time saving, cost effectiveness and customer satisfaction.

- 1994, an airplane part of a Chinese airline crashed, killing 264 people, due to a Software bug
- 1985, THERAC - 25 a radiation therapy device caused 3 deaths and 3 others critically injured due to a Software bug.
- 1999, Failed satalite launch - 1.2 billion dollars loss, due to a Software bug.

**Software testing can save lives**.

**Benifits of Software testing**

- Cost-Effective: It is one of the important advantages of software testing. Testing any IT project on time helps you to save your money for the long term. In case if the bugs caught in the earlier stage of software testing, it costs less to fix.
- Security: It is the most vulnerable and sensitive benefit of software testing. People are looking for trusted products. It helps in removing risks and problems earlier.
- Product quality: It is an essential requirement of any software product. Testing ensures a quality product is delivered to customers.
- Customer Satisfaction: The main aim of any product is to give satisfaction to their customers. UI/UX Testing ensures the best user experience.

## Testing in Software Engineering

Testing in Software Engineering is a process of evaluating a software product to find whether the current software product meets the required conditions or not. The testing process involves evaluating the features of the software product for requirements in terms of any missing requirements, bugs or errors, security, reliability and performance.

There are 3 types of software testing

### Functional Testing

Functional testing is a type of testing that verifies that the software functions according to the specified requirements. It focuses on testing the system's functionality by providing appropriate input and comparing the output to the expected results. This type of testing is concerned with what the system does.

**Examples**

- Unit Testing: Testing individual components or modules of a software to ensure they function correctly. For example, testing a login function to verify that it correctly validates usernames and passwords.
  
- Integration Testing: Testing the interaction between integrated modules or components to ensure they work together. For instance, checking if data flows correctly between a user interface and a database.
  
- System Testing: Testing the entire system as a whole to ensure it meets the specified requirements. This could include testing an e-commerce application to verify that product selection, checkout, and payment processes work as expected.

The 3 above are also referred to as **testing strategies**

- User Acceptance Testing (UAT): Testing conducted by the end-users to validate if the system meets their requirements and is ready for production use. An example is a customer testing a new feature in a mobile banking app to ensure it fulfills their needs.

### Non-Functional Testing

Non-functional testing focuses on the non-functional aspects of a software application, such as performance, usability, reliability, scalability, and security. Performance testing, a subset of non-functional testing, specifically measures the system's performance under a specific workload.

### Maintenance

Maintenance testing involves testing the system after it has been modified, to ensure that changes or updates do not introduce new defects and that the system continues to meet its requirements. It includes regression testing and other activities related to maintaining the quality of the software over time.


# Summary

- Define Software Testing/Software Testing Definition: Software testing is defined as an activity to check whether the actual results match the expected results and to ensure that the software system is Defect free.
- Testing is important because software bugs could be expensive or even dangerous.
- The important reasons for using software testing are: cost-effective, security, product quality, and customer satisfaction.
Typically Testing is classified into three categories functional testing, non-functional testing or performance testing, and maintenance.
- The important strategies in software engineering are: unit testing, integration testing, validation testing, and system testing.
