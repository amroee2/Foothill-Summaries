# C#

C# Is an object oriented programming language that is a mixture of both Java and the C Family.

OOP came out in 2001 after the Rivarly between CPP and Java, and solved a lot of issues that where in both languages.

**What makes C# a good programmling language?**

## Approachable 

C# Has a lot of similar syntax to CPP and Java, it uses semiconlons, curly braces, zero indexed and supports object oriented concepts like namespaces, classes, methods and properties.

## Strongly typed 

Like c plus plus and java, C# requires the developer to state the data type of variables/parameters they declare either primitive (int, double, float, char, long...) or reference types like class instances, arrays, interfaces...

C# also allows to use **var** to declare a value, and then uses **inference** to find out the datatype of the declared value in compile time.

## Resilient and Safe

### Safety

C# Also has exceptions, which are events the distrub the normal workflow of the program.

For eaxmple, if an index out of bound happens (I.E access an index equal or larger than the array length) in cpp, it's highly likely to cause a memory corruption, while in C# and Java it would raise a **runtime exception**

## Object Oriented 

C#, as previously mentioned, supports object oriented programming with all OOP pillars (Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, Polymorphism).

It also has functional features, or pre-defined methods for the classes like arrays.

For example, instead of finding the sum of integers in an array like this:

We can use this:

## Open Source & Cross Platform, General Purpose

- Open Source & Cross Platform: C# Is currently an open source project, its also used to develop console and web apps on windows, mac and other operating systems.
- General Purpose: C# Is used to develop multiple applications/programs, including mobile and web applications, games and more.
