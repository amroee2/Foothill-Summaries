# LINQ

Language intergrated query is a sql-like syntax for C# and other visual basic languages.

LINQ provides a consistent query syntax that works across various data sources such as in-memory collections (like arrays, lists), XML documents, databases, and more. LINQ brings the capabilities of querying databases to the C# language syntax itself, making it easy to filter, sort, and manipulate data. 

There are two main styles for writing LINQ queries in C#:

- Query Syntax: Similar to SQL and typically more readable for complex queries.
- Method Syntax: Uses method calls and lambda expressions, providing more flexibility and is often more concise.

```
List<int> numbers = new List<int> { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 };

// Query Syntax
var evenNumbersQuery = from number in numbers
                       where number % 2 == 0
                       select number;

// Method Syntax
var evenNumbersMethod = numbers.Where(number => number % 2 == 0);

foreach (var num in evenNumbersQuery)
{
    Console.WriteLine(num);  // Output: 2, 4, 6
}
```
It can be used for searching, ordering, aggrevate functions (sum, min, max...) and other common operations.
